                                    The media played a significant role in
                                    amplifying Trump's Twitter influence.
                                    News outlets often reported on his tweets,
                                    which further increased their visibility.
                                    This helped Trump bypass traditional media
                                    and communicate directly with the public.
                                    However, this also led to concerns about the
                                    media's role in amplifying false or
                                    misleading information.

                                    politics.
                                    His tweets often influenced policy decisions
                                    and public opinion. For example, his tweets
                                    about immigration and the border wall shaped
                                    the public debate on these issues.
                                    His tweets also caused controversy within
                                    his own administration and led to
                                    resignations.
                                    Trump's use of Twitter also changed the way
                                    politicians communicate with the public.
                                    It showed that social media can be a

                                            offending tweets to regain access.

                                            January 8, 2021, for tweets that
                                            glorified violence and risked
